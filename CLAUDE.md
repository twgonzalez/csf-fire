# Fire Evacuation Capacity Analysis System

## Project Purpose

Open-source Python pipeline that analyzes fire evacuation route capacity for California cities to:
1. Establish **objective development standards** (ministerial vs. discretionary review)
2. Generate **impact fee nexus studies** (AB 1600 compliant)
3. Enable **what-if analysis** for proposed developments

This is a legally-focused system. All standards must be objective (no engineering judgment, no discretion).

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11** via uv (`uv run python ...`)
- **GeoPandas** — spatial operations
- **OSMnx** — road network download and analysis
- **NetworkX** — graph/routing algorithms
- **Pandas** — tabular data
- **Click + Rich** — CLI
- **PyYAML** — configuration

## Run Commands

```bash
# Analyze a city (downloads data + calculates capacity)
uv run python main.py analyze --city "Berkeley" --state "CA"

# Evaluate a specific project
uv run python main.py evaluate --city "Berkeley" --lat 37.87 --lon -122.27 --units 75

# Force refresh cached data
uv run python main.py analyze --city "Berkeley" --state "CA" --refresh

# Regenerate the primary demo map (REQUIRED after any visualization code change)
uv run python main.py demo --city "Berkeley"
# → output/berkeley/demo_map.html  (window.JOSH_DATA inlined; loads app.js from CDN)
# → static/v1/app.js               (GENERATED — shared CDN bundle; also regenerated here)

# Anti-divergence test: validate JS engine against Python (no npm needed)
# REQUIRED after any change to agents/export.py or static/whatif_utils.js
# NOTE: static/whatif_engine.js is GENERATED — never edit it directly.
#       Edit agents/export.py (algorithm JS strings) or static/whatif_utils.js (utilities).
#       analyze regenerates whatif_engine.js automatically.
#       demo regenerates static/v1/app.js (which embeds whatif_engine.js).
node --test tests/test_whatif_engine.js
# Prerequisites: analyze + demo must have run first (generates graph.json + test_vectors.json)

# Validate project coordinates against the Census geocoder (REQUIRED after adding projects)
uv run python main.py geocode --city "Berkeley"
uv run python main.py geocode --city "Berkeley" --apply   # write corrections to YAML in place
```

## Adding Projects to a Demo YAML — Coordinate Protocol

**NEVER estimate or guess lat/lon coordinates.** Wrong coordinates place pins on the
wrong road segments and produce incorrect FHSZ lookups, ΔT calculations, and route
assignments — invalidating the legal analysis.

**Project YAML location:**
- Public cities → `config/projects/{city}_demo.yaml`
- Private cities → `config/private/projects/{city}_demo.yaml`

The pipeline resolves both automatically via `_resolve_config()` in `main.py` —
no flag or path argument needed. Just run `demo` or `geocode` with `--city`.

**Required workflow when adding a new project:**

1. Set the `address` field to the human-readable project address.
2. If `address` is not a clean geocodable street address (e.g. it's an intersection
   description, annotated access note, or address range), also add a `geocode_address`
   field with a clean single-address geocodable form:
   ```yaml
   address: "599 Union St (ingress/egress) / Clark Ave (egress only), Leucadia"
   geocode_address: "599 Union St, Encinitas"
   ```
3. Set `lat`/`lon` from the Census geocoder result — run:
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py geocode --city "CityName" --apply
   ```
   This calls the U.S. Census Bureau Geocoder (no API key required) and patches the
   YAML in place while preserving all comments.
4. For projects where geocoding fails (intersection descriptions with no street number),
   look up coordinates using the parcel APN in the county assessor GIS portal or
   San Diego County SANDAG parcel viewer, then run `geocode` to confirm distance is
   within 0.5 km.
5. Regenerate the demo map:
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py demo --city "CityName"
   ```

## Primary UX Artifact

**`output/{city}/demo_map.html`** is the primary stakeholder-facing UX — the interactive
multi-project comparison map used for demos, city attorney review, and planning presentations.
This is the ONLY output file external users need to open.

### Architecture: CDN-hosted rendering + inlined city data

`demo_map.html` uses a split architecture for scalability to 50+ cities:

- **`window.JOSH_DATA`** (inlined in the HTML) — per-city data: road graph, parameters,
  FHSZ GeoJSON, brief HTML strings. Does not change with visualization updates.
- **`static/v1/app.js`** (served from CDN at `https://twgonzalez.github.io/josh/static/v1/app.js`) —
  shared rendering code: WhatIfEngine IIFE, what-if UI panel, brief modal overlay.
  All cities load this file automatically on open.

**CDN versioning:** Major version is in the URL path (`v1`, `v2`, …). Only bump when the
`JOSH_DATA` schema changes in a backward-incompatible way — update `_APP_JS_VERSION` in
`agents/export.py` and `_APP_JS_CDN_URL` in `agents/visualization/demo.py`. Within a major
version, push updated `app.js` to CDN in-place; all cities auto-update on next open.

**Current delivery mode:** `app.js` is **inlined** into `demo_map.html` (fully self-contained,
works from `file://`, no internet dependency). When ready to switch to CDN delivery (so feature
updates reach cities without resending the HTML), replace the inline `<script id="josh-app">`
block in `_inject_josh_data_bundle()` with `<script src="{_APP_JS_CDN_URL}" defer></script>`.

**What requires a full Python rebuild (`demo`):**
- Road network GeoJSON layers, popup HTML (Folium-baked)
- Project markers, AntPath flow traces, demo panel detail cards
- Brief HTML content, city-specific `what_happened` overlay
- City data changes (new project, re-analysis)

**What does NOT require rebuild (CDN update only, once switched to CDN delivery):**
- What-if panel UX (layout, labels, buttons, results display)
- Brief modal chrome / overlay styling
- WhatIfEngine algorithm fixes (schema-compatible)

**After ANY change to `agents/visualization/`**, regenerate it:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
uv run python main.py demo --city "Berkeley"
# → output/berkeley/demo_map.html          (public city)
uv run python main.py demo --city "Encinitas"
# → config/private/output/encinitas/demo_map.html  (private city)
```

Output paths depend on whether the city is public or private (see Private City
Infrastructure below). Public city output is git-ignored in the public repo.
Private city output is tracked in `josh-private`. Do NOT leave a stale demo map
— always regenerate before sharing.

**Brief / popup labeling convention (user-facing):** Criteria are labeled **A** (Applicability
Threshold — size gate), **B** (Site Parameters — FHSZ zone + degradation + threshold), and
**C** (Evacuation Clearance Analysis — routes + ΔT test) in `brief_v3.py` and the demo map
popup. SB 79 transit proximity is a separate informational scenario (no badge, footnote only).
The underlying algorithm is Standards 1–5 / 5-step; A/B/C is the presentation layer used
in all user-facing outputs (determination letter, popup, briefs).

## Objective Standards — v3.0 ΔT Standard (Agent 3)

All standards are algorithmic — zero discretion allowed. Do NOT add "professional judgment" language.

1. **Standard 1**: `units >= 15` (integer comparison — universal size gate)
2. **Standard 2**: Buffer project location 0.5 mi → filter `EvacuationPath` objects by bottleneck/exit osmid proximity
3. **Standard 3**: GIS point-in-polygon test against CAL FIRE FHSZ; sets `project.hazard_zone` string which controls mobilization_rate and ΔT threshold; `in_fire_zone=True` for HAZ_CLASS ≥ 2
4. **Standard 4 (ΔT Test)**: `ΔT = (project_vehicles / bottleneck_effective_capacity_vph) × 60 + egress_penalty`
   - `project_vehicles = units × vpu × 0.90` (mobilization constant, NFPA 101 — not zone-dependent)
   - `egress_penalty = 0` for stories < 4; `min(stories × 1.5, 12)` for ≥ 4 stories
   - Flagged when `ΔT > threshold(hazard_zone)` where `threshold = safe_egress_window × max_project_share`
   - **No baseline precondition** — routes already at LOS F are tested equally
5. **Standard 5**: SB 79 transit proximity flag — **informational only**, never raises tier

**Final determination:**
```
DISCRETIONARY           — Std 1 met AND any serving path ΔT > threshold
CONDITIONAL MINISTERIAL — Std 1 met AND all paths ΔT within threshold
MINISTERIAL             — below size threshold (Std 1 not met)
```

**ΔT engine** (`agents/scenarios/base.py`): `compute_delta_t()` iterates `list[EvacuationPath]` from Agent 2.
**Routing** (`agents/scenarios/wildland.py`): `identify_routes()` returns `EvacuationPath` objects filtered by proximity.
**Orchestration** (`agents/objective_standards.py`): most-restrictive-wins across WildlandScenario only (Sb79TransitScenario never contributes to tier).

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Source | Format |
|---------|--------|--------|
| FHSZ Zones | CAL FIRE OSFM ArcGIS REST API | GeoJSON |
| Road Network | OpenStreetMap via OSMnx | GeoPackage |
| City Boundary | U.S. Census TIGER | GeoJSON |
| Traffic Volumes | Caltrans AADT (PeMS) — fallback: road class estimate | CSV |

## Caching Policy

All downloaded data is cached with a 90-day TTL. Use `--refresh` to force re-download.
`metadata.yaml` records source URLs and download dates for every file (required for legal
audit trail).

- **Public cities** → cached in `data/{city}/` (git-ignored in public repo)
- **Private cities** → cached in `config/private/data/{city}/` (fully tracked in josh-private
  for complete backup — all data files committed including roads.gpkg, graph.graphml, etc.)

## Current MVP Phase

Phase 1 (MVP): Agents 1–3 only. CLI output to CSV + text. No web UI, no fee calculator, no PDF reports.

Phase 2 (next): Agent 4 (impact fee calculator) + Agent 6 (Folium maps).
Phase 3 (later): Agent 5 (Flask what-if web app) + Agent 7 (Word/PDF reports).

## v3.4 Migration Status (branch: feat/v3-delta-t)

✅ Replaced v/c marginal causation test with ΔT (marginal evacuation clearance time).
✅ **v3.4: Mobilization is now constant 0.90 (NFPA 101 design basis). `mobilization_rates` dict removed.**
✅ **v3.4: FHSZ affects road capacity only (hazard_degradation). Not mobilization.**
✅ Hazard-aware capacity degradation applied by Agent 2 (HCM composite + NIST Camp Fire validation).
✅ Building egress penalty (NFPA 101/IBC) for buildings ≥ 4 stories.
✅ `EvacuationPath` dataclass with per-path bottleneck tracking (argmin effective_capacity_vph).
✅ `Sb79TransitScenario` replaces `LocalDensityScenario` (informational flag, no tier impact).
✅ Audit trail v3.4: shows ΔT per path, bottleneck details, hazard degradation, egress penalty.
✅ `data/{city}/evacuation_paths.json` persisted by Agent 2 after routing.

## Road Network Overrides

OSM highway tags are often wrong for non-standard jurisdictions (e.g. internal covenant
roads in Rancho Santa Fe tagged as `primary` when they are local collectors). These errors
inflate HCM capacity, distort the evacuation route heatmap, and produce incorrect routing.

### Override file location and naming

| City type | Override file path |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Public city | `config/cities/{city_slug}_road_overrides.yaml` |
| Private city | `config/private/cities/{city_slug}_road_overrides.yaml` |

The file is auto-detected by `acquire_data()` — no config key needed. Overrides are
applied after `fetch_road_network()` returns OSM data, before `roads.gpkg` is saved.
The corrected values are baked into `roads.gpkg`; a `--refresh` run is required when
overrides change.

### Schema

```yaml
road_overrides:
  - name: "La Granada"          # match by road name (case-insensitive, full match)
    highway: "secondary"         # reclassify OSM highway tag
    reason: "Internal covenant road; primary tag is an OSM error"
    osm_correction_pending: true # flag for upstream OSM fix

  - osmid: "6024716"             # match by OSM way ID (scalar only; not list osmids)
    width_ft: 18                 # physical road width for Standard 6 / IFC §503
    access_type: "dead_end"      # dead_end | single_access | one_way | two_way
    reason: "Clark Ave — below IFC §503 20-ft minimum"
    source: "City Engineering Survey 2024-03"

  - name: "Linea del Cielo"
    highway: "tertiary"
    lanes: 2                     # explicit lane count override
    speed: 25                    # speed limit override (mph)
    reason: "Hilltop residential dead-end; secondary tag overstates capacity"
```

### Supported correction fields

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `highway` | Re-classifies OSM tag; automatically re-derives `road_type` and `lane_count` (when estimated) |
| `lanes` | Overrides lane count; clears `lane_count_estimated` flag |
| `speed` | Overrides speed limit (mph); clears `speed_estimated` flag |
| `width_ft` | Stores physical width (feet) for Standard 6 / IFC §503 (future use) |
| `access_type` | Stores access classification for Standard 6 (future use) |

### Audit trail

Every overridden segment gains two new columns in `roads.gpkg`:
- `highway_original` — original OSM highway tag before correction
- `override_reason` — reason string from the YAML entry

The number of corrected segments is logged at `analyze` time and recorded in
`data/{city}/metadata.yaml` under `roads_overrides`.

### When to use vs. when to fix OSM

- **Fix in OSM first** when the tag is clearly wrong (e.g. a residential cul-de-sac
  tagged as `primary`). Mark with `osm_correction_pending: true` in the YAML.
- **Use overrides** for corrections that require local knowledge not in OSM (physical
  widths, gated access, COA-mandated restrictions), or where OSM edits may be reverted.
- **Never use overrides to tune ΔT results** — only use them to correct factual OSM
  errors or add physically-verified data. All overrides must have a `reason` and `source`.

### After adding or changing overrides

```bash
uv run python main.py analyze --city "CityName" --refresh
uv run python main.py demo --city "CityName"
```

## Pending Methodology Work

1. **Demo map hand-placement of project pins** — no file yet
   The Census geocoder can silently match the wrong block of a street that crosses I-5
   or another major barrier (e.g., "599 Union St" matched the west-of-I-5 segment when
   the actual project entry is east of I-5). The fix is a click-to-place UI in the demo map:
   - Add a "drop pin" mode to `output/{city}/demo_map.html` — user clicks the map, the
     lat/lon appears in a panel and can be copied directly into the YAML
   - OR: a standalone `place_pin.html` helper (no server needed, pure Leaflet) that opens
     the city bounding box and lets the user click to get coordinates
   - Coordinates set this way should be noted in the YAML comment as "hand-placed YYYY-MM-DD"
     rather than geocoded (see Clark Avenue Apartments in encinitas_demo.yaml for the pattern)
   - The `geocode` command already detects mismatches (MISMATCH status + km distance) and
     shows the matched address string — that is the first line of defense. Hand-placement
     is the resolution when geocoder quality is insufficient.

2. **Dual / multiple egress accounting** — methodology pending
   Clark Avenue Apartments has TWO egress points:
   - 599 Union St: primary ingress/egress (two-way, 19.5 ft wide)
   - Clark Ave: egress only (one-way outbound, 19–21 ft wide)
   The current ΔT engine finds the bottleneck of the *single worst-case* EvacuationPath.
   If a project has two independent egress paths, total egress capacity may be the sum of
   both — vehicles split across routes during evacuation.
   Questions to resolve:
   - OSM `oneway` tag is already in the graph but not surfaced to the ΔT engine — needed
     to distinguish one-way egress-only from bidirectional access
   - Should ΔT sum effective capacities across all exit paths, or take worst-case single
     path? (Conservative: worst-case; realistic: proportional capacity-split model)
   - City conditions of approval (Clark Ave egress-only by COA) must be modelable via
     `{city}_road_overrides.yaml` — not just OSM tags
   TODO: after width inference ships, inspect the Clark Ave Apartments audit trail to
   verify both Union St and Clark Ave appear as separate EvacuationPath bottlenecks.

3. **Physical site access standard (new Standard 6)** — no file yet
   The Clark Street (Encinitas) problem — 200 units at end of an 18' wide dead-end street —
   is not a v/c ratio problem. It is a physical access problem governed by IFC §503
   (fire apparatus access roads). Objective thresholds already exist in adopted fire code:
   - Minimum road width: 20 ft one-way, 26 ft two-way
   - Dead-end without turnaround: flag if > 150 ft serving > N units
   - Single access point: flag for large projects (city-adopted N)
   This should be a new scenario subclass (`agents/scenarios/site_access.py`) using OSM
   `width` tags and road geometry as inputs.
   **Infrastructure ready**: `{city}_road_overrides.yaml` now supports `width_ft` and
   `access_type` fields (stored in `roads.gpkg` as pass-through columns). Standard 6
   can read these columns without additional data pipeline work.

## Private City Infrastructure

Client cities (Encinitas, Solana Beach, etc.) are kept out of the public repo using a
two-repo pattern. The private repo (`josh-private`) lives at `config/private/` inside the
public repo and is gitignored by `csf-josh`.

### Detection and Path Routing

`main.py` contains three helpers that route paths automatically — no CLI flags needed:

```python
_is_private_city(city_slug, base_dir)   # True if config/private/cities/{slug}.yaml exists
_resolve_data_dir(city_slug, base_dir)  # config/private/data/{city} or data/{city}
_resolve_output_dir(city_slug, base_dir)# config/private/output/{city} or output/{city}
```

All four CLI commands (`analyze`, `evaluate`, `demo`, `report`) use these helpers.
Adding a new private city requires only a city YAML in `config/private/cities/` —
no code changes.
